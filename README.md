üìâ Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn, a critical task for businesses looking to proactively retain customers and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service based on their historical behavior and demographic data.

üìÅ Project Structure

The repository contains the main analysis in a Jupyter Notebook:

Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb: Contains all steps of the project, including data loading, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
